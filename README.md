# Cocktails Web App

## Introduction
The Cocktails Web App is a project that uses the Cocktails API to show data on the page. The goal of this project is to create a web app with two pages - home and favorites. The home page will have a listing of cocktails and the favorites page will show a separate list of the items you've favorited.

A button to add a cocktail to the favorites list.
